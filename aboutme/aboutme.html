<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<h3> I am Yadel Teshager. I am a firsr year scholar
at SMASH UC Berkley. </h3>
</div>
<p> During my free time, I paint, go biking, and
watch netflix.
I came to the United States when I was six years old.
During my freshman year, I was in my school's JV basketball team.
The most important things in my life are
<ol>
<li class="important"><b>1. God </b></li>
<li class="important"><b>2. My family </b></li>
<li class="important"><b> 3. My eductaiuon</b> </li>
<li class="important"><b>4.  My music </b></li>
<li  class="important"><b>5. My food </b></li>
</ol>
<p> My music taste differentiates depending on my mood for the day.
Majority of the time you will see me with my earbuds, jamming out.</p>
<p> While I am listening to music, I like to eat.
My favorite food is original hot wings from wingstop and their Louisiana cheesy fries.
Food is a huge part of my life. Not only does it give me energy, but it is also the love of my life.
One thing I miss about my childhood is watching disney channel almost everyday and how carefree I used to be.
My favorite colors are black, yellow, red, and white.
On netflix, I currently finished watching
<ul>
<li class="important">- Queen of South </li>
<li class="important">- Vampire Diaries </li>
<li class="important">- The Society </li>
</ul>
<p> Before I came to SMASH Berkeley, I went to Seatlle, Washignton with my dad and sister. In Seatlle, I went to the famous Gum Wall, the Great Wheel, Pike Place Market, and Boeing museum.
We stayed for about three days and I realized that I would never move to Seatlle. This is because everyday it is <em> raining </em>, even in summer.
I only like rain whem I am sleeping. Overall, my trip to Seattle was fun, enjoyable, and interesting.</p>
